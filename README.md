# Analysis of Presidential Speeches

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze the evolution of language and sentiment in presidential speeches over time. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we will explore how discussions on democracy and governance have changed through different presidencies. Our analysis will provide insights into the frequency and context of these discussions, highlighting significant shifts in language and sentiment.

## Research Question

How has the language and sentiment related to democracy and governance in presidential speeches evolved over time? What are the key themes and topics that emerge in different periods, and how do different political figures compare in their usage of terms related to democracy and governance?

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, we will:
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset containing presidential speeches.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis, including visualizations such as:
   - Distribution of speeches over time.
   - Word cloud of common terms.
   - Frequency of speeches by each president.
   - Sentiment analysis overview.
3. Conduct a detailed analysis on the frequency and context of discussions on democracy and governance using NLP techniques.
4. Identify significant changes in language and sentiment over time.
